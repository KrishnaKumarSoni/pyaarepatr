The application must provide a form containing input fields for users to enter details about their partner, including but not limited to name, gender, relationship duration, shared memories, personal traits, and custom messages.
The form should also have an optional input field to specify a writing style, tone (romantic, funny, poetic, deep, etc.), or any specific keywords the user wants in the letter.
The system should validate all input fields to ensure a smooth experience, providing inline error messages where necessary.
After submission, the userâ€™s inputs should be passed to a structured GPT-4o prompt where variables dynamically insert user-provided information to generate a highly personalized love letter.
The generated love letter must be stored securely and be accessible through a unique shareable link that allows anyone with the link to view it.
The shareable link should be designed for seamless mobile and desktop viewing, ensuring responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.
The shared love letter page should have a clean, beautiful design with soft pink, purple, white, and red color schemes.
When the letter is opened via the unique link, a randomly selected background song from a set of 10 hardcoded YouTube video links should start playing automatically.
The background song should play in an embedded, headless manner such that the YouTube video remains invisible while only the audio plays.
Users should be able to control the music with Play, Pause, and Mute buttons embedded in the letter page UI.
The letter page should have subtle heart confetti animations triggered every time any button is pressed (such as Play, Pause, Mute, or Copy Link).
The sender must have the ability to preview the final letter and its experience (including music, animations, and layout) before finalizing and generating the shareable link.
The form and final letter page should have smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as fade-ins, soft zoom effects, and animated hearts.
The interface should follow a modern, aesthetically pleasing UI design with rounded edges, gradient backgrounds, and a romantic theme.
The system should allow users to regenerate the letter with modified details if they are unsatisfied with the initial output.
A lightweight, static front-end framework should be used for speed and efficiency, ensuring fast load times.
Error handling should be implemented to provide meaningful messages in case of issues with letter generation, API failures, or link access errors.
The form should have a progress bar or a visual indicator to make it engaging and fun rather than feeling like a long, dull input process.
A small Easter egg (hidden feature) could be included where a super personalized poetic letter is generated if a specific keyword or phrase is entered in the input fields.
The entire system should be lightweight and optimized for smooth performance, ensuring a delightful, seamless experience for both senders and recipients.
